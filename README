No longer sample code.
Given a consumer_key, consumer secret, and oauth access tokens, it will deliver a tweetstream.

Features:  2 features that I'm super proud of, and proof to myself that when I say to myself:
It can't be that hard, sometimes it isn't actually that hard.

Feature 1:  when it comes accross a retweet, it puts both the quoted text, and the text of the
            original message.  This means when the end ( which is where ppl always put the URL)
	    gets cut off, you can see the full message.  Means you may have to see the message 
	    twice, but there's no way around this.

Feature 2:  get_reply_chain.  people often use @replies, but no client but mine has support for 
            showing them inline. When luddite sees that a message is an @reply it shows the 
	    entire conversation inline

TODO:
Figure out OAUTH, enough so that I can feed it credentials and get a token back.
