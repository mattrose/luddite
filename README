Luddite is a command line twitter app that mimics an old style bbs forum interface. 

Why, you ask, would I run luddite?
1.  Simple, fast, familiar (at least for me) interface
2.  Read tweets in chronological order, not reverse-chronological order
3.  Read reply chains in situ
4.  No cut-off retweets.


Authentication: "ruby twitcmd.rb auth"
this will give you a URL to copy and paste into a browser, which will then ask you for your username and password, and return a PIN.  This PIN can be entered into the console. 

Features:  2 features that I'm super proud of, and proof to myself that when I say to myself:
It can't be that hard, sometimes it isn't actually that hard.

Feature 1:  when it comes accross a retweet, it puts both the quoted text, and the text of the
            original message.  This means when the end ( which is where ppl always put the URL)
	    gets cut off, you can see the full message.  Means you may have to see the message 
	    twice, but there's no way around this.

If the #NDP win half as many seats as EKOS says, they're going to collectively regret a lot of things they've said about current Senators.

Feature 2:  get_reply_chain.  people often use @replies, but no client but mine has support for 
            showing them inline. When luddite sees that a message is an @reply it shows the 
	    entire conversation inline

TODO:
merge vasciano branch
General Code cleanup.  It's a mess that needs to be refactored, but on the principle of release, release, release, The last thing I'm gonna do is rename twitcmd.rb to luddite.rb
rework the display logic to take advantage of highline more.  Highline is awesome.


Bugs
It's getting kinda hard to read.
